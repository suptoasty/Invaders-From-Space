The rebounding of the aliens may not work with more than 1 row(which i named column with out thinking)
A base class could have been used for bombs, player, missile, and aliens. I just didn't ever implement it
could have made draws template functions so i don't have duplicate code, but i forgot templates existed even though i made a template class last week :(
